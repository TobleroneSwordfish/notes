Harvard: segregation, can be optimized for read only and low power instruction memory
Instructions are safe from "accidental" overwriting
disadvantages:
ahahaha

Von Neumann:
Instructions = Data = Information
Most common processor memory architecture

Major bottleneck with data retrieval
Problem only getting worse as memory capacity has increased and processor speed has increased
Data throughput rates haven't kept up

Workarounds:
Caching, so you don't actually have to do the fetches

move 29 into acc
store acc (29) in loc 9
move loc 9 (29) into acc
subtract 29 from 29, storing 0 in acc

in all honesty, my mindset perfectly satisfies me most of the time so they can go frick themselves
Sounds painful
i was reading a teenage fantasy book some years ago and i remember this sentence:
(some guys were being assholes) 'Jace suggested they do something anatomically impossible'
That's a good way of putting it
