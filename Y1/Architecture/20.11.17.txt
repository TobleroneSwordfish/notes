Giving people time to think is a bad idea, that's how existential crises start
Gonna be building so much on haskell

Now I'm interested
//a friend sometimes naps in my place but he's also a bit of an ass lately so earlier he asked me 'when do you finish with uni today?' and i said '4'
//and he said 'okay i'll come by at 4' (he hadn't asked me earlier or anything and i'm annoyed)
Is he homeless?
//his residence is far
Allsorts are the results of a liquorice maker getting really drunk and deciding that coconut was a good idea

Just write it in java and run it on a potato, it'll eat the entire potato in order to run, but it will run
"JVM was a good idea" - no-one ever
Oh gods we're doing java next year
Just port it to java
LITERALLY ALL OF IT

Opcodes vs operands, yeah yeah
is functions and args

Almost set my room on fire with a soldering iron
Used to buy circuits from maplins, like 3 quid for a clock or a thing that does things

Instructions are abstracted control signals

Should be 'A', goddamn one length strings

As instructions are symbols they have to be decoded

Fetch -> decode -> execute

Instruction loads into decoder, spits out control signals, loads data into register, run thing, stick output back in memory

How can you write that squeek?

There was a poll a while back, and the irish accent was voted most sexually attractive.
That's a great little pointless fact

n bits gives a 2^n instruction set
duh

Not all bit strings are valid instructions because you probably don't have exactly 64, 128 instructions

Z?! KILLITWITHFIRE
//best dialogue: "WHAT IS Z?" "YES"

op-code is a subset of the bit patterns

Instruction is composed of op-code and operands, control flags etc.

"Not exactly true" understatement

ARM used in low power environments, phones, pi's etc.
MIPS is nerds - microprocessor
Intel x86 is Intel's godawful mess - like windows, a monopoly of shit
"Competition improves standards" pah
The other one was probably just nerd shit too

How do you get numbers in registers to do those instructions on?!

Combinatorial logic is shit, because it breaks if you change anything - bespoke
DMUX, less efficient in terms of transistors, better design wise
