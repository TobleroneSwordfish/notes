if lily says no we kindly make her leave and by kindly i don't mean kindly
Fully agreed
el agrees too so i'll speak with greg
On the one hand Greg is chill, so either he'll go along with it or be too chill to do it
nah i think he realises we need to rent a place SOON
Myah
does it actually make you more grumpy half the time?
I don't know about half, I'd have to do some kind of study
more or less than half?
I wouldn't comment without statistically verified data
well get that study going

ISA - instruction set architecture

RISC vs CISC

Definition of the instruction set of a processor

Backwards compatibility *spits*

ISA what to do
Microarchitecture how its done


------ISA contents-----

Op-codes
Datatypes
Registers
Memory addressing modes
Memory architecture
Interrupts and exception handling
I/O
...


1 bit op-code uhuh

One-to-one mapping of bit-strings to meanings (op-codes and operands)

Spoilersssss

Because lecturers

Halt and catch fire, useful

Instruction classes:

Arithmetic, comparison, memory, control flow

More complex classes:

Vector processing, digital signal processing

------------RISC and CISC--------------

Reduced vs Complex Instruction Set Computer

RISC: Minimal, lightweight, and fast instructions.
Complex instructions are made up of less complex ones
All instructions have same fixed length and similar runtime

Just keep chaining split merge modules

CISC: Rich, large instruction sets. Smaller assembly code.
If you're going to do something, there should be an instruction for it
Mixed length instructions - can cause mess
Processor ends up complex and in theory slower
CISC doesn't have to use up 32 bits to say halt and catch fire
More efficient self destruction is a real concern for modern computing

RISC or CISC may be slower or faster depending on specific usage

Quite possibly the most powerful man in the world charging with a flamethrower.
This is far more worrying than best korea

You two worry me sometimes...
