Ian username is csijh - can get calender

Don't bother emailing, turn up at office before 4PM.

This guy's throat makes me want to cough.

C

Lowest level before assembly starts to make things architecture dependent.

Imperative tells processor exactly how, functional tells what needs to be done.

Coder -> Programmer -> Developer

Function can technically only process input to return result, procedures can perform other tasks - print to screen, send data etc.

compile command syntax with GNU: gcc -std=c99 -Wall hello.c -o hello
c 1999 version, turn on all warnings, filename "hello.c", output to program "hello"
./hello to run from current directory
see aside on make for further compiler info
