So they're both upside down and the right way up
Because roots
Yeah

SO the tree structure
Could be the roots
Roots of a tree go everywhere, like branches
So tree is both ways up
I'm at like 25 hours now
Everything is a little bit marshmallow
//i'm walking you home
May need it
I still say there is very little difference between extreme sleep deprivation and being pissed
//i had elliott explain quantum key distribution to me
//it's gonna be an epic assignment
Tracking an amazon van
"challenge" - gets pet dragon
//playing a mage is a challenge to me cause i usually go for brute force
//only in video games -Hmmmmmm......
//you get a pet dragon no matter what class you play as
//you actually use it the least as a mage
//so i couldn't decide what to name the dragon
//guess

//guess
Eragon?
//MALLOC

Zelda the green cap one right? ;P
//i was talking to a greek friend today and in greek we don't use ? we use ; for questions
//but i clicked 1 instead by accident (in greek keyboards ; is on q)
//so i sent a second message saying ;*
//but on fb that's a kissy face
//he knows me well enough to know i'm just a fucking idiot
Looks more like a horribly fucky c dereference to me
???
A pointer to a semicolon. Shudder*
//WHY
She is the sensible one
Pulled an all nighter as well
//poke
Guess what I was going to type

To be fair, he is compressing it a lot
It's almost golfed
//golfed?

Code golfing, you try to write a program using as few bytes as possible
//i just realised for my tree the topmost position has both pointers downL and downR pointing to the first element.
//MAAAAAYBE should have mentioned in the readme
//fuck
I guess if he's not sure about the code he'll probably compile it
//in unite house and orchard heights, there's a big leak under the buildings so they'll come to fix it
//no water for two days
//l->i->o->p->m->f
f->u->c->k->o->f->f
//s->o->r->r->y
//p->o->k->e
Poke::~Poke()
//i was wondering, since you said you don't know who you'll rent with, if you'd like to consider my flat
//5 of us will rent together for next year (most likely)
I mean, I have literally no idea other than that so far, so I guess yeah
//i asked my flatmates about it and they said they need to properly meet you first, but they seemed neutral
Fair
From what I've seen of them I like em
//drunk greg
//that's all i need to say
Best entertainment
//pros: you're not in a residence
//cons: amount of poking'>=amount of poking
I'll buy a padded jacket
//i thought you meant straightjacket
//and i was about to ask: for me, you, or greg?
Actually that seems like a useful thing to have
//when we started talking about it i was like
//GUYS GUYS GUYS is it's a flat with an attic can i have dibs?
//and they were like you know the attic rooms are usually the smallest right
//and i was like YEAH BUT THEY'RE COOL
Agreed, attic rooms are just cool
Halfway to tree houses

Thomas the dank engine
A great cultural figure among my people
//greek tv had it too
//just a hilarious facial expression
Oh no, not tank, dank. BIG difference
That face can only be described as dank
//i think i've only ever seen the word dank in the context of memes
EXACTLY
//why did i come to this fucking lecture
Up until this point we knew it, but I've never come across re-black before
//fair
Also red-node racism *ding*
//*ding* XD
I mean think about it: black nodes are safe, they never make trouble, it's the red nodes that are the dangerous ones
Where have you heard that before?!
//you. need. sleep.
I think the black nodes need to leave the NU
Only way to keep the damn red nodes out
Fucking brexit.
//fucking brits
I fully agree
//apparently i sleeptalked in greek last night and freaked elliott out
//i've done the opposite at home
//freaked me mom out
Strange arcane whispers
Summoning demons by muttering in greek
//nah, latin
Very zen

I like sleep deprivation
I need to get some cider and make it better
//no
Awww, but mum!
//no, jonny, you've had enough mind altering effects this week
It's monda- oh wait
//straightjacket
You can get out of them if you can dislocate your shoulders
//yeah i've seen a guy do it live
//first day of freshers week, we had the thing in the su, remember?
First off, fuck that guy //i liked him! WHYYY? He was so cheesy //i like cheesy!
Second that straight jacket was shit
//mate i went to cabot tower with elliott and at some point i looked at him and smiled and he said what? so i said
//i'm just admiring the view
//i am cheesy, cheesy is me
Ah hang on
I'm allergic to you then
