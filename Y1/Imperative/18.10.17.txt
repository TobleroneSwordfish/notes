typedef struct birb Birb

Birb x = yadayada

All I can smell is lasanga smoke, it was in there for 8 goddamn hours

I wonder how many times you can just type "bird" in a row and have it compile

Three chapters of you making that joke, oh boy...

More word assosciation, pointer -> poke

But if (->) -> poke does that mean that (->) -> (->)?

Seems legit

I blame you lot behind me, you're probably reading this because I would be.

Would fit angsty teenager look

Convention for pointers: int *p

Incrementing a pointer adds the type width, not the raw memory.
p+1 if p points to an int

Adding one, english is pointless. Actually, I think it can mean adding more than one in some cases.

So in for (int i = 0; i < n; i+= <something>) <something> is the increment and i is incremented

&n means pointer to n

null pointer in c is NULL, but of course in c++ it's nullptr

Wear your glasses!

Run out of snickers?

Then they decided to make win8 and integrate CORTANA with the bloody OS
Now it's not even good to use anymore
