BLOOD AND MALLOC
//you're weird and i feel like it's my fault
Oh no, you are far too late.
Been weird for years

MY BLOOD IS MALLOC

MALLOC IS LIFE, MALLOC IS THE UNIVERSE, MALLOC IS THE CAUSE OF MOST MEMORY LEAKS, BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.
//will you help me with m alloc when i inevitably fuck up?
Sure, it's not actually that bad.
See the second bit? DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

A SPIRIT, REANIMATED BY MALLOC.
//next tieme i write fantasy, a cool bad guy or god will be named malloc AND IT'S YOUR FAULT
I think a few c function names would make good gods.

The great god Ferror, slain by Eof, son of Fflush.
//ferror sounds too much like terror

AND SO ENDS THE GREAT SAGA OF BLOOD AND MALLOC

EOF
//atoi

I feel like that would be a good city name
//yeah
//so if you do char* s = malloc (4) ; you make the pointer point to the beggining of four empty spaces? and tghen how can you allocate things to those spaces?
Use the pointer like an array, so s[i] = 'h'
Or pointer arithmetic, but just don't
//okaY
Also, as he just said, malloc takes bytes not number of things

BROTHER OF THE GREAT MALLOC, THE DARK GOD CALLOC INITIALIZES ALL TO BE 0, ALL IS NOTHING BEFORE CALLOC
//mate you're literally putting my brain in epic fantasy mode

Increasing length arrays done using realloc and multiplying the size, rather than adding.
