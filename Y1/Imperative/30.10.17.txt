#include <iostream>
IT LIES TO MALLOC, YESSS
//I HOPE NICK SHOWED IAN THE BOARD WITH MALLOC (I HADN'T REALISED I WAS WRITTING IN CAPITALS)
That is the code used by 99% of c programmers
Never Eat GetS
Always close files.
// so if i want to use a pointer, how do i define it in main?
SOmething like

int *i;
int thing = 6;
*i = &thing;
printf("%i\n", i);

prints 6

Never use getline or readline, ie never use non-standard. Yeah, we get that by now.

%[^,]%*c is valid c code

Never use fscanf either

Use feof for user input, just in case

rb and wb stop processing line endings

fprintf shits some string into a file
fflush forces the shit

always error check fopen, because file could be missing, wrong disk, universe, etc.

But, everything is modular, so how can there be a limit? You just keep going to higher levels of abstraction, until the code become if (goingToCrash) { dont() };

That never happens
