do not submit codio, if locked out visit Ian
can write one program over multiple (3?) weeks, submit progress at end of each week

comment at top of source to summarise file
#include equivilent to library being in the file
angle brackets in #include indicate to root to default folder, "" indicate to root to current directory
entry point must be called "main" - note lowercase
setbuf sets the buffering type, usually NULL for immediate output
printf is PRINT with Formatting
main returns 0 for success, anything else - default 1 for failure
you can use custom error codes for higher level scripts
function lacking return statement returns garbage from register, main exception as it always returns 0
%d inserts integer - equivilent to %i (because C, %d is more conventional). %f inserts float (including double), etc
function order important, forward definition exists to edge cases and recursion
feel like me and Theano are contributing most of the questions. Well, mostly Theano
don't just shove everything in the return statement :(
max int is (2^31 - 1) as the 32nd bit is a sign bit, long is 64 bit (32 in windows because fuck you)

--CYGWIN--

make sure that code works on linux/cygwin - NOT just native windows
write code for majority cross platform code, deal with windows shit later
