== true, best joke.
Only reason you'd ever actually memorize it is if you used it every day. 26 random codes are tough.

Encoding: publicly known way to transform a message for sending
No secrecy - anyone can read

Encryption takes a KEY.

Encoding produces a code, encryption produces a cipher.

ASCII - 7 bits per character, 2^7 (128) combinations, so no support for different alphabets or weird characters.

Unicode is 8, 16, 32 bits, 2^32 (up to 4294967296) combinations
Variable length characters
UTF-8 is modern standard, includes just about everything

Email based on ASCII.

Text bytes starting 0 are ASCII, 1 starting are local

WHen you have 65k values, why not add elvish?

First few bytes of unicode are ASCII

One byte in decimal is 3 digits, binary is 8, hex is 2.

Because it takes less memory to store, that's it. Invented in the days when memory was measured in KB.

Generally if it has letters it's hex

Base64 is encoding, NOT encryption.

"NO WAY!" - that guy from the maths lecture that I still think is hilarious.

Mmmm, but I guess it makes it less of a memory test, and more of a skills and understanding one

That lab sheet you TOTALLY read, eh?
