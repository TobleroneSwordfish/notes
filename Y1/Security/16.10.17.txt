Public key encryption
RSA was original public key encryption

Public key can be visualized as a padlock
Secret key can be visualized as a ... key

One way function takes in random secret key, spits out public key
Cannot be reversed to take in public and spit out secret

Three aglorithms:
key generation - spits out related public and secret key

encryption takes message, uses public key to spit out ciphertext

decryption takes ciphertext and secret key, spits out message

Theano! We need you! No-one else can answer questions!

D(sk, E(pk, m)) = m

Oh yeah, security labs this week is sending encrypted emails

Charcters after '=' sign is checksum, one block of Base64

Public key encryption offers no authenticity, anyone can send you encrypted messages - kinda the point

Public key encryption is very slow, due to the complexity of the mathematical algorithms

Hybrid encryption encrypts the message with symmetric encryption, then sends the symmetric key by public key encryption
- PGP works using this

PGP is free, open source version of RSA encryption with unrestricted key length.

US government and RSA tried to sue Phillip Zimmerman, he distributed the source code as a book under free speech,
it went all over the planet, the US government gave up eventually.

Something you can't solve with guns?! Very un-american

PGP went commercial, Zimmerman started selling his software

Free software GNU people cloned PGP as GPG and distributed it as free software

Vimeo, ofc - youtube would censor it.

Even NSA cannot theoretically break GPG, of course there are ways around such as malware

1% of pop use GPG, often enough to put you under government surveilllance

One way linear function

What about 1 quintillionth of a thing?

###Note: calculate roughly how much matter bender halved to 1 quintillion copies would consume###
Important science

Linear function: f(c * a) = c * f(a)

"Proof of that, you stare at it and go 'DUH'" - David 2017

Elliptic curves is voodoo

RSA has massive keys

EC is better
