Assume that the enemy knows your system.
Security must rest solely on the assumption that no-one has your keys.
System with n bits of security takes 2^n steps to break.
DES uses 56 bits, AES uses 128-256
bits of security, breaking the system by brute force takes 2^n operations.
128 is minimum
for EC system, key length is twice the bits of security
average password is 20 bits, 40 is a very strong one.
ergo passwords cannot be used for encryption
techs are always the same, today it'd probably be an XKCD
encryption should hide patterns
key length != security level
