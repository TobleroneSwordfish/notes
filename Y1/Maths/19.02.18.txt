Baba yetu muthafuckers
have you ever been to a club?
Look at my face and try to guess
no?
No shit
there's the best drunk food kebap place at the bottom of whiteladies
You are the third person to recommend that shop I think
but you have to be drunk4
so i might get you drunk on cider and take you there
it has to happen at some point
Maaaybe
Dah dummmm
Zilch
i love him so much
He's judging us for that answer but also just not
I don't think it's possible for him to be pissed off
yesterday that guy and a girl were talking about xanax and i was like wait i thought that was an american thing, can you get it here?
and they both just look at me awkwardly and i'm like '...legally?'
Drug law is one of those odd things in how it is enforced
Technically you can go to prison for having weed, very rare anyone actually does tho
the girl claimed that you can't be arrested for being under the influence, only for causing disturbance or having some on you
I guess because it can't be proved? Unless you do urine tests
Although whether you can trust a stoner for legal advice is questionable
Also that wrap has made me want pizza now
And no pizza
Forever
An empty void of no pizza
surely lactose free cheese is a thing
It is, but no pizza place sells pizzas with it
They sell "vegan cheese" which is basically plastic with fibers in it
fairs
this conversation about xanax started because the guy got a message from a random person saying thanks for the help on friday
and he had a five hour memory gap bc xanax and alcohol
so he chatted with the person and apparently the person was lost and his phone was dead so the guy walked him to the place he needed to go and let him use his phone
so like he's really nice
Wholesome stoner
ikr
he later tried to convince us acid isn't so bad
Druggies are very like christians really
also i tried normal cigs for the first time
gross af
Ikr, I've inhaled enough of that crap over the years to tell you that
Better than hemlock (?)though
You know hemlock? Deadly poisonous plant that looks roughly like cow parsly
Some classical guy offed himself with it once
Kids where I grew up used to smoke the dried stalks like cigars
No idea why
we call it conium in greek
right
i won't question it
Well none of us appear to have lung cancer yet
Maybe smoking hemlock is fine...
As I say, just like mormons or jehova's witnesses (I haven't done that in ages)
It pisses me off too
Glasses
that wasn't so hard
What she said
SOrry, had to
But yes, I was expecting worse
see i didn't realise he would ask me on the spot
This is why you never attempt to answer any questions
bUt It WoRkEd
For now
KAPITALIST SCUM
Me 100%
here's the thing
i like strategy games
but i like straightforward strategies
often brute force
so i usually tank in video games
tabletop rpgs are an exception because roleplay
I tend to play support, but I love the support roles that can also murder things
Playing ranger water mage healer atm in Divinity
bards
you mean bards
In DnD terms yah
Because DnD doesn't really multiclass?
course it does
So you could be a pyro barbarian or some such
pyro?
Fire mage
you could be a wizard or sorcerer with fire spells and a barbarian
But then you need int
So you're a smart barbarian
So a sorcerer is a pretty wizard?
wizard's a nerd, sorcerer is talented
Can't stand talented people
:P
start thinking of a character for my campaign pls
Mmmm, when are you planning on starting that?
hopefully saturday
as soon as everyone has a character
Will think
And will fight for a fez
Expected lower on the viva
I sounded like a fucking idiot for most of it
class average is 70
there's many people in the group chat being like 75,80,90
that i'm just wondering how many people were in the fourties and fifties
Like, I messed up in some stupid way on every single question and failed to answer the last one completely
And got 75%
one of the other guys yesterday is doing eng maths and this year he is only doing 1 unit because he failed it
Must be really shitty to have to do that
yeah, my parents would fucking murder me
think of the money
Ikr, I think mine would just be quietly disappointed
I might try to muder myself but that's beside the point
thank fuck your average is like 75 percent then
in fourth year you need a 50 to pass
and elliott got a 58 in one of his exams (worst he's gotten) and he was kinda freaking out and i didn't know you needed 50 so i was like wth
one time said friend who has anger issues got really pissed off at a dude like 4 years younger than him
and i saw him pull a pocket knife out of his back pocket and put it into his front pocket and keep his hand there
so adrenaline, slow motion, etc
and i crossed the line between brave and stupid by stepping in front of him and hugging him
did not get stabbed
he did almost break my neck once but that was an accident
I have almost broken and pulled so many things doing jujitsu
Just have to know when to stop
yes
but neck
is a rather important one
Yeeah, neck locks are different
There is a throw in jujitsu which basically involves putting someone in a head lock and then flipping them vertically
Is fun
