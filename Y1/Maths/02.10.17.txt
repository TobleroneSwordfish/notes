Everyone's doing logic atm.
Interpretation is arrangement of values for prop vars
Tautology always true for any interpretation, contradiction is opposite - always false

Satisfiable if true for at least one
Unsatisfiable if false for all
Formula is a contradiction iff its negation is a tautology
Contingency is neither a tautology nor contradiction, must have one value assignment that is true and one that is false
Logically equivalent iff p <-> q is tautology
Single A4 sheet can be taken into class test.
NO WAY.
NAND is up arrow
NOR is down
{^, V, ¬} functionally complete
By DeMorgan's then {^, ¬} and {V, ¬} are
CNF from DNF truth table --figure it out
