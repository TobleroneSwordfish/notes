The issue I'm having is NOT drifting
suuuuugaaaar
650?
Worth an all nighter?
if i get above 60, yes
i mean, they told us to have 8 sources and i have 18
+10 sources = +10%
I WISH
if you go one word above the word limit you get -5%
Yegh, although at least you havea high word count.
400 is pain
The list of ridiculously easy things I have fucked up is extensive
same tbh
's' = '{'
The notes are great if you already understand everything in the lecture
I'm pretty sure that's just conversation. And you do have a rather ballistic attitude to questions
Very enthusiastic
Eyyy, this almost has some kind of relevence. Not really.
Poking in class again Potter?
no need to call me sir proffessor
Greg speaks drunk all the time?
AH, didn't get driven out? Just asking
DISAGREE DISAGREEEEE
Fun
You have answered a lot of his questions, I think he'd have noticed
But then David, so who knows
Game naem?
King's Bounty: Armored Princess
Hex turn based combat? I like
Been playing Divinity OS 2 recently, similar game
Be fair, two of your party are literally dargons
troops are lvl 1-5 and you have up to 5 troops. i have 4 troops lvl 5 and one troop lvl 4 (paladins, i love paladins)
I don't think it ever went this far, maybe FP3? Stopped at 2, thank god
i like 3 a lot
I did better in FP2 than M1, exams are weird man
