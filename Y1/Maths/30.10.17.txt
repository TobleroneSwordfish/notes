New lecturer! This can only be an upgrade. Also vectors instead of logic, again can only be positive.
He looks american. Don't ask me to logic that, but he does. Damnit.  //he does
And yes, he IS one of those people.
// five weeks of sitting closer to the front cause we can't fucking hear anything
//try to spice up your voice for a start
He actually kinda sounds like he has a sore throat, maybe we're judging unduly
//sorry
//yas
Read through notes before lectures. Just like I should have been doing in architecture.
//will you though
I also swear I'm not diagnosed dyslexic
// yeah we're just saying you're undiagnosed
//today i spelled bitches as bitses
My phone tried to autocorrect bits to bitches, I fully blame google
//huh, something that isn't my fault for once
I'll find a way
Blame Theano and shoot Nicole
Then blame Theano for shooting Nicole
//fuck off

Okay, actual bloody notes:
//suuuuure
//TRUST HIM HE'S AN ENGINEER
I knew you'd do that.
Anyone reading this would think I have multiple personality disorder
//i don't think that would be their first thought
Maybe you are just a voice in my head?
//nah
I can read about half that.

Linear mapping = transformation
Subspace inside vector space
Linear does not contain non-linear, really.
//no shit
I personally welcome our robotic overlords, fuck these monkeys. Fuck english.
//truuue
Everything is next week, I like this attitude.

That is maths, I actually recognise it as such, I like it. I'm American, fuck you. //no he's american

	//doimg powers of three
why do you know 243 off the top of your head?
//i don't, i calculated it, i'm not THAT sleepy
Generally no. -> Generally no?
Google marketing thing, turn . into ?
Works in the examples they show, looks damn stupid most the time.

u.v = 0 = cos(90) therefore perpendicular or othogonal
*insert skyrim meme* illusion 100

Someone, somewhere has to have contradicted this.

The Adventures of Mr. Schrodinger's cat.

No difference here.

Mr Schrodinger's cat woke up one day and was an unrealised quantum possiblity.
Now, Mr. Schrodinger's cat didn't like being an unrealised quantum possiblity.
It was also in a box, and it didn't like that much either.
//it sounds slightly like a neil gaiman short story. please go on
It could smell randomly decaying radioactive isotopes, very nasty.

It has to end there because quantum, you can't know.
//But since the cat is conscious, it has to be alive. So it knows the answer
But the narrator is not the cat, therefore the narrator doesn't know.
