Matrix can be thought of as a vector of columns or a vector of rows

Linear system can have a single solution, no solution, infinite solutions.

3 variable linear system defines a plane

When planes intersect at a line (1D subspace of R3), infinite solutions

Have just recalled that we don't have lectures tomorrow, FUCK YEAH

Am browsing r/surrealmemes. Makes more sense than this lecture.

Gaussian Elimination used to solve nxn matrices

x1 + 2x2 + x3= 2
2x1 
ah fuck it

1 2 1 2
2 2 3 1
1 -2 4 3

V
1 2 1 2
0 -2 1 -3
0 -4 3 1


0 = 1
