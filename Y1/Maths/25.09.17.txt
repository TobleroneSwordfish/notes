Third lecture. Slightly less fuck. But it's maths. Fuck.
Prepare for workshops.
Summer 2018 exam 100%
Class test on logic first 4 weeks during workshop
Mock after TB1
Friday problem class if fucked up
Always turn up, even if you've solved everything, might be able to teach others. Weeeeeell okay.
Solutions do not need to be handed in, do it because failing sucks.

Logic and proof.
Syntax defines symbols and objects
Semantics associate meaning

proposition is a statement (x is true)

1 n
2 y
3 y
4 y
5 n
6 y
7 n
8 y
9 y
10 y

propositions can be abbriviated using prop vars
let p be x is y
light_is_on makes more sense
propositions combine to form compound

2^n rows in truth table wherer n is number of vars

^ and conjunction & .

V or  | + inclusive or

xor p or q not both

¬ not "It is false that p"

-> if then "p implies q"

true when either p is false or q is true
p q p -> q
T T   T
T F   F
F T   T
F F   T
When p is false, we cannot say whether q is true
if p is true and q is false then obviously the implication is false
p is antecedent, q is consequent

p -> q
q -> p converse
¬p -> ¬q inverse
¬q -> ¬p contrapositive - equivilent to p -> q

inverse and converse equivilent
positive and contrapositive equivilent

if and only if <->
(p -> q) ^ (q -> p)

ie p and q have same value TT or FF

Unary connective takes one argument, binary takes two.

alphabet: A set of propositional variables (p, q, r, s etc), propositional connectives (true, false, ¬, ^ etc), punctuation "(" and ")"
grammar: Each of the propositions is well formed, if p is WFF then ¬p is, if p and q are WFFs then so are p ^ q, p V q, p xor q, p -> q, p <-> q

Exercise - do it.

Semantics defined in truth tables, as they define the meaning of operators
