Fucking maths. Even in the apocalypse, there is still maths.
Apparently we're smrt, great
If asked to prove logical equivalence, stop drawing truth table after finding false biconditional
My brain just told me to put a semicolon on the end of that line, waaaaay too much c.

Assume P(k) true for SOME value of k, not ALL values of k
Begin at the beginning and continue until you get to the end. Great words of wisdom, I have no idea where they're from.
Googled it, original quote is "Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end; then stop." by Lewis Carroll
You poor fuckers

P(1) = (1 * (1 + 1))/2 = 1 therefor true for n = 1

Assume that P(k) = true

k(k + 1)/2 + k + 1

(k + 1)(k/2 + 2/2)

(k + 1)(k + 2)/2

(k + 1)((k + 1) + 1)/2

therefor P(k) -> P(k + 1)
therefor P holds for all positive values of n

--actual computers?!--

Loop Invariant is true before the loop, during the loop, and after the loop.

mysquare(int n)
{
	int s = 0;
	int i = 0;
	for (i= 0; i < n; i++) 
	{
		s += n;
	}
	//or
	while(i < n)
	{
		s = s + n;
		i = i + 1;
	}
	return s;
}

I like the for better though. This kind of case is literally why for loops exist, why shoehorn a while in here?!
I guess it makes the truth table more legible, but readiblity > all

i = k - 1
s = (k - 1) * n

oh, then i = k and s = k * n

base case: k = 0
s = 0 * n && i = 0

Assumption: for k = m
s = m * n && i = m

To prove: for k = m + 1
s = (m + 1) * n && i = m + 1
s= mn + n && i = m + 1

s = s' + n && i = i' + 1

by assumption
s = (mn) + n && i = m + 1

Waaarblgh...?

Oooookaaaaaay, great.
