Mostly all we've done is trees
Probably, it's just binary trees if you've done them
nope
is fractals based on that?
Ye, a lot
no point conibg to the lab then
You could try to figure it out, mostly by poking us
Crickey
Blimey!
Shock
Very british
Poking will prevent nap
Oh, and in the fractals code he calls a bush a tree and it messed me up for half a bloody hour
Fractals
I always wonder if the Haskell interpreter is written in Haskell, seems appropriate
our tutor was like 'you're never going to use haskell after this year unless you for whatever reason want to do a project with nick'
Plz no
ikr
SHit reef knot
tug
This is like bopit now
I always hated those 12 thing bopit machines
BAPIT!
TWIST IT!
POOL IT!
That's all there is, pretty much
Everyone's worried about haskell

toBush :: Ord a -> [a] -> Bush a
toBush = foldr f k where
	--f :: a -> Bush a -> Bush a
	f = insert
	k = Tip
yeaaaah reading week will be like 30% this, 15% arcitecture 15% maths, 10% imperative, 5% security, 10% sleep, 15% fun

10% luck, 20% skill and 15% concentrated power of will
5% pleasure 50% pain, 100% reason to remember the name

elemBush :: Ord a => Bush a -> Bool
elemBush x Tip = False
elemBush x (Node l y r)
	| x < y = elemBush x l
	| x == y = True
	| x > y = elemBush x r

That moment happens so often in vidya gamez or otherwise
I feel like you hurt this guy once
i kinda did.... we're good friends now tho
it's not my fault he gets a crush on every other female he sees
Only every other?
yeah it'd be overkill otherwise

if bush is fully balanced then complexity is O(log2 n)
also the dm was my bf for a while and one of the other players complained that i get less hits from bad guys and that's favorable
treatment. i was a ranger. i fought with a fucking bow, from the back of the field.
To be fair, much of my experience of playing ranger in other games is being jumped on by every goddamn rogue
....fair

There is a lot of fairness here
it was a ridiculous campaign
on the bright side, two of the players (who didn't know each other before) became a couple during it
on the dark side, it's a rather disfunctional relationship

SO AM I
I KNOW
PERFECTLY LOGICAL

some days my bed seems really comfy
some others i wake up and my back hurts and i can't find a good position
idek anymore
The beds aren't great
Too short too
Had a double bed at home, slept diagonally across it
i had sth between a double and single, but more importantly a comfy matress
Found some memory foam in a warehouse once, big improvement

Note to my future self trying to actually read this mess, I'm not sorry, screw you.
(i'm sorry on behalf of both of us, please don't find me and punch me when you try to revise)
I'll send the punch over facebook
or via encrypted email
do you know where we'll get the grades for security? email? safe? blackboard? pigeon? Safe I think, don't know the link tho
we'll probs get an email
i figured it SHOULD be fairly okay to get a 25/30, fair?
so if you get 25 in both assignments you have 50 + whatever you get in a multiple choice exam
how hard can it be to get an 80?
A multiple choice on higher dimensional vector space? Uhhh, yeeeah
fucks sake jonny
