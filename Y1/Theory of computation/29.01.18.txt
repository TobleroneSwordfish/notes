A x B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B

Concat: given two languages

L ⚬ L` = {w ⚬ w` | w ∈ L, w` ∈ L`}

{a} ⚬ φ = φ

(Kleene) star

L* = L ⚬ L

{a}* = {ε, a, aa, aaa, ...}

{0, 1}* = {ε, 0, 1, 10, 01, 11 ...} all possible binary strings

φ* = {ε}

The class of regular languages is closed under
union, concat, star

Union accepts any words accepted under either one of the languages unioned

Proof of regular languages closed under union:

L, L` langauges, there exists

M = {Q1, Σ1, δ1, q01, F1}

M` = {Q2, Σ2, δ2, q02, F2}

Q = Q1 x Q2

q0 = (q01, q02)

F = F1 x Q2 U Q1 x F2

δ  (Q1 x Q2) x Σ -> Q1 x Q2
δ((q1, q2), a) = (δ1(q1, a), δ(q2, a)) - the pair of the states each machine will transition to when it reads the a


------------Non-deterministic finite state automata (NFAs)---------------

DFA with inconsistant states, ie two different ways to take with same input.
All DFAs are NFAs
All regular languages therefor are accepted by an NFA
