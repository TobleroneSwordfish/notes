Communism is Unity, Unity is the people
Communism is a CFG

Queue machine can accept 0^n 1^n 2^n
By popping 0's from the top and pushing 1's to the bottom etc

Turing machine: {Q, Σ. Γ, δ, q0, qaccept, qreject}

Q - finite set of states
Σ - input alphabet, does not contain blank
Γ - tape alphabet - Σ + blank
δ - Q x Γ -> Q x Γ x {L, R}

Accepting config - u qaccept v
Rejecting config - u qreject v
Starting config - q0 w

uaqbv yields δ(q,b) = (p, c, L) --read b, replace with c, move left

upacv

which yields δ(q,b) = (p, c, R)

uacpv


qbv yields δ(q,b) = (p, c, L) --cannot move left
pcv

Turing machine M accepts w if there exists C0, C1, ..., Ck configs

st. C0 = q0 w
Ci yields C(i+1) for all i <= k + 1
Ck = accepting (u qaccept v)

L(M) = {w | M accepts w} is the language recognised by M

A TM is a "decider" if it halts for any input

A language L is "decided" by a TM M if M is a decider and M recognises L
