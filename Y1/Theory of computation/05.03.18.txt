CNF now is Chomsky not Conjunctive, nice

Rules are:

A -> BC
or
A -> a

B, C not start vars

only start vars can point to ε

1) Remove start var from RHS by adding new S pointing to old

2) Remove ε rules:
for any rule R -> uAw
where A -> B|ε
add R -> uw

So for R -> 0A1A0
R -> 01A0 | 0A10 | 010

When you do this you sometimes just shift the ε
So just keep doing it, dumbass
Until you can get down to S -> ε

Hey, my keyboard can do greek today without opening random alt menus
Nice
Have no idea why, but nice
Something something windows 10

3) Remove any A -> B - cannot go to single var
To remove A -> S, replace S in RHS by all actual definitions of S
And yes, we have to patch the new start var we just added, because ofc we do
"I know guys, while trying to get this to fit a rule, let's add bits that don't fit the rule" - theory

4) "Fix it" - direct quote
Removing X -> ABCD...

A -> u1u2 .. uk
A -> u1A1
A1 -> u2A2
A2 -> u3A3
...
A(k-2) -> u(k-1)uk

Concrete:
S0 -> ASA
S0 -> A A1
A1 -> SA
WHY WOULD YOU CALL THAT A1 PEOPLE WILL GO MAD

Need more coffee
STarted drinking coffee
Bad idea
Don't do it kids

But, I am here on 2 hours sleep
ANd am almost awake
So maybe coffee is helping

A -> aB

X -> a
A -> XB
