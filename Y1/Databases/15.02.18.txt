You don't need a join for that case
You can just use a where
select * from Lecturer, Unit where Lecturer.id == Unit.director and Unit.title == "Databases"

SELECT votes FROM Candidate

WHERE Party.name = "Labour" AND Ward.name = "Stockwood";

SELECT Candidate.name, Party.name, Candidate.votes FROM Candidate
INNER JOIN Party ON Party.id = Candidate.party
INNER JOIN Ward on Candidate.ward = Ward.id
WHERE Ward.name = "Southville"
ORDER BY votes DESC;

SELECT Candidate.name, Party.name, Candidate.votes FROM Candidate
INNER JOIN Party ON Party.id = Candidate.party
INNER JOIN Ward on Candidate.ward = Ward.id
WHERE Ward.name = "Knowle"
WHERE Candidate.votes > ALL (
SELECT votes FROM Candidate
);

SELECT Candidate.name, Party.name, Candidate.votes FROM Candidate
INNER JOIN Party ON Party.id = Candidate.party
INNER JOIN Ward on Candidate.ward = Ward.id
WHERE Ward.name = 'Knowle'
ORDER BY votes DESC
LIMIT 1;

SELECT County.name, County.code, Region.name, Region.code, Country.name, Country.code FROM County
