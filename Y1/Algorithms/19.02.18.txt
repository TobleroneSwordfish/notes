Only reason I can think if him doing this is that he was or is a chain smoker
Has to always be fiddling with it
He holds it like a smoker
Notice how he never puts it down
And never lets the other end touch anything other than the board

wouldn't it make more sense in dnd if you had a certain amount of action points per turn based on your class and dexterity for example
so like 1 action point is 2 feet of movement, 5 action points is an attack, spells depend on the sort of spell it is etc, drawing a weapon is like 2 action points instead of a full action ffs
Almost the exact system Divinity uses, movement uses AP based on your move speed, you can spend AP to attack, spells cost certain amounts,
moving boxes and stuff around takes AP, there are even spells that give you more AP like adrenaline
Works great because all that can be determined mathematically because vidya game
Not sure how you'd do stuff like movement AP in DnD though
mEaSuRiNg tApE
and you could make it be like say you have two players and a monster
player one moves towards the monster (1 ap) player two shoots the monster (5ap) monster approaches (1ap) and player one and monster keep doing stuff till they reach 5ap
so it's not absurdly round based
So you have a concurrent turn system?
At the same time
also assuming you need some time to recover after a big action like an attack
I really like the AP system in general, in Divinity it allows all sorts of stupid combos
Like you invis a ranger, they just sit cloaked for 2 turns and save AP then 1 turn combo the boss
saving ap doesn't make sense tho
It's kinda like you're resting or preparing I guess
And stuff like using adrenaline loses you 2 AP next turn because you're tired
Our rogue has a combo that allows him to cast two adrens in one turn, he has literally no AP the next turn
ap in my brain is kinda like how much time each thing takes
so some weapons would take different amounts of ap like a dagger might take 3 while a greatsword might take 7
now i want to make a homebrew
I'd play it
Would take ages measuring everything, but it'd be interesting
You would have to assign AP to all spells tho
redddittt
yeah i might just take an existing system and make that change
i hope to play rpg every week next year
I hope to not play divinity EVERY evening next year
It's a problem at this point, but the game is just so good
not today
today civ
