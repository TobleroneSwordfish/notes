Is probably more modern and dynamic
why'd you not sleep?'muricans
fucking americans
'watched' superbowl with elliott and his friends last night (was dozing off most of the time) and we had bets on who would win
i was right.
Pretty sure I know this lecture, tempting to try sleep through it

Fuckign sausages
?????
Right, so you have pack of sausages
And you're all happy
Because sausages
Then, you're a fucking idiot
And leave them out overnight
Then you have to decide whether to eat them
What do you do?
i'm guessing you had them and it didn't go well?
You might assume that
I started cooking them
Then googled it
Bad idea
Screamed and threw them out
But now I'm sad because no sausages
get more sausages
Probably will
But still
Wasted sausages

Basically the dreaded goto statements
But they're actually standard practice in assembly
i don't wanna do assembly
Me neither, I know someone who wrote a few thousand lines of it once
I wrote the same thing in C# in like 5
wow
do you ever like wake up and are absolutely certain something is very wrong
but you don't have any rational arguments to back it up and you can't pinpoint what it is?
My explanation for that is that something really bad did happen and then I lost my memory and am just remembering the feeling
This is often caused by carbon monoxide poisoning
WHich is eventually fatal
see one) i have decent memory and 2)last night i was introduced to elliott's carbon monoxide detecting box that beeps really loudly
but he said it was beeping because he pressed a button that made it test and the beeping meant it was fine
There are few times when beeping means fine
fuck off

I have a thumb
you have two
I have two on my hands, yes
i literally did not even mean to be sarcastic                                     
hungry
angerey
why?
Politican reform is by definition impossible
okay jonny
Think about it
If someone rises to a position of power within the current system then they have no incentive to reform
some people have fucking ethics
Not that high up, you don't get there with ethics
well i'm gonna try anyway ;P
Let me know how it goes
Other way to reform the political system
Glorious revolution
Never works because it fucks up infrastructure and leaves the population generally pissed off, so then it generally leads to a mess
and because people get drunk on newfound power, see french revolution
Behead EVERYONE
Yes
Or any attempt at communism
Fucking depressing
get some sleep
WOuld love to, unfortunately there's this annoying guy at the front making noise
want earphones?
ExCiTeD mAtH gUy
He can cheer anyone up
And then you remember it's a math lecture
And then you're sad again
the stuff we're doing now aint that bad
what's our 9am on wednesday?
i have an offer to go pub and then club on tuesday
You have options, you could go and then skip algorithms
You could go and turn up to algorithms pissed and sleep deprived
Or you could be an antisocial lout and actually study
i'll study today that's enough 
Sounds good to me
fooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
I was going to have a sausage sandwich
;(
