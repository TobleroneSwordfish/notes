He's actually using reddit, the bloody madman

Carl's cool

Carl Henrik Ek, he mentioned him
He's my personal tutor

Insert
T(n) = An^2 + Bn + C
  So something like O(n^2)

Basically, it has a nested loop, it's probably n^2

O(n^2) is the set of functions that go to infinity at worst as fast as n^2

O(n^2) includes O(n) and O(1) algorithms

O(n^2) algorithm may execute in O(n) time or less

Did he just put chalk in his mouth...?

Also vampire jacket

We are witnessing a man having a Bad Day

Also no reddit spam yet, I am disappointed guys

So as x -> infinity, f(x) -> c
Basic maffs
