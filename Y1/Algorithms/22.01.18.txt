pooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooke
10% coursework, that you're meant to still do every other week
FUCK THIS SHIT

we have four exams in may-june
i like coursework
I really like coursework, but for 10% it's basically pointless
they're doing it to make us attend
Ik, but if you know the shit you shouldn't have to turn up
do you?
Well you lose 10% otherwise
i meant do you know the stuff\
Somewhat, but it's the principle
                                                                                  
The other video was really peircing beeps
If you hand someone something, 90% of the time they'll take it then question it after
You can do some really stupid things by handing someone a thing and then rushing off
are you in the 90% jonny?
Oh yes, fully susceptable
Well okay, it only works if they don't know what you're doing
will try again tomorrow or in like 20 minutes, you'll have forgotten ;P
