YAAAS SPRING

Have literally been doing this shit for the past several weeks

Do you have to have needles on the damn slides?
/needles?
There was a needle on the last slide to indicate injection
EAGH
/do you dislike needles?
Okay, better question, do you like needles?
/i'm neutral on them
/i love knitting needles tho
They can't give you an anurysm
SPelling excepted
/aneurism
/i think?
Close enough
/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
/he speaks almost as calmly as david may
/also just remembered the dan thing
/lol

We are literally going to have to implement this exact thing
/now this is OO

Aaron actually paying attention in lectures
lmao

HAVE YOU USED A COMPUTER BEFORE?!

/maybe

/what does aaron study?

Forensic computer science
/faaancyyyy
Myah, although his uni is... Eh.
LEctures sort of don't happen sometimes, IT is non-existent
Makes you thankful for SAFE honestly
/which uni?
Somewhere
In britain
/why do you not want to say?
There is an assumption in there
/uni?
Nope
/DO YOU NOT KNOW?
/JONNY
/JIMMY
/FFS
REMEMBER.
NOT NOT KNOW
I'M NOT THAT BAD
MAYBE
ALSO HAVE TURNED INTO SHARLENE
/goshdidlitidarnit jimmy
/mike says that
qase3rft
/if you delete that do they not get the notif?
/or do they just not know what the fuck
The second one, I muted Aaron three times for doing that
He wrote a macro to @ and delete the message anyone who annoyed him
ABout 500 times a minute
/well why did you annoy him?
/he is a man of power
/also i remember that's where i got the idea
I am a man of greater power as I am an admin with a bot

The thing with Aaron is that he's offensive and rude equally to literally everyone
And always makes the worst jokes
And times them reaaaally badly
Like one time I join the call and he's ranting about people with allergies
And that's how he found out I was lactose intolerent

/i don't want to talk with aaron anymore

I am THIS close to beating you over the head with this POS
Right now I really just want a new laptop so don't tempt me
