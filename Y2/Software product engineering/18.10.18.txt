I'd say this isn't A levels and I don't care
/hearing a german guy say greek words in english is amazing
Modern world, our common language is english but our scientific is mostly greek

/don't splat carrot at me
Carrot is dangerous
Also very loud
Bad carrot
/and pretty phallic
Well, not any more
If a phallus looks like that, ehhh, it may have issues
/don't judge

Unless you're blizzard, then release testing is done by everyone else on patch day
Also helpfully the day when you realise you have about half the amount of server space you needed
EVERY GODDAMN TIME

/he got too excited so he dropped uni

Well, maybe not bees

I really don't
I hate everything I write after a while

You should probably know context to this
So there's a major esports tournament run in shanghai
Hosted by the infamous james
The whole thing is a massive shitshow, the feed goes down constantly, audio issues, the production crew were asleeeep or missing half the time
James was desperately trying to hold the entire thing together as the whole thing fell apart
Badly
So he ended up basically doing a really awful standup routine and bemusing the entire rest of the cast
And this lasted for several days before the whole thing collapsed and james got called an ass by the CEO of valve
Poor james
/but was any of it his fault?
Not the production issues, but the weird cringy stand up was... Interesting
You could see his sanity draining over the course of the event
While he desperately tries to cover the mess that was the tech
/i feel for him tho
Myah, poor guy probably had his career completely fucked tbh
minused like "-"
Goddamnit james
Forgot they fired him between segments
He just kinda disappears halfway through the event after the final bad joke

/finish that goddamn carrot
But is loud
I will eat on way to phys
/fair
/a friend is horribly hangover so after lang eng i'll get her soya milk
/(i don't know why she wants soya milk but i won't question it)
Some elaborate hangover cure?
