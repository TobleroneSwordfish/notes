Do you think Nick's internal narrator speaks in Haskell?
What if haskell was bees
fuck off nick
that is the worst possible answer to that question

it's right there nick
RIGHT FUCKING THERE
I CAN SEEE IT

I like that student

Some examples of values of type Fix (ListF a) are:

> In EmptyF 
      |
{ListF a (Fix (ListF a))}

This works because EmptyF :: ListF a k for any a or k even that mess above

Note that the type of In is:
> In :: f(Fix f) -> Fix f

So the example above is where f = ListF a

> In (ConsF 5 (In EmptyF))
	     |      |
	     |{Fix(ListF a)}
      {Fix(ListF a)}

for two elements:
> In (ConsF 6 (In (ConsF 7 (In EmptyF))))

So now we have enough to finish a definition of fromList:

> fromList :: List a -> Fix (ListF a)
> fromList Empty = In EmptyF
> fromList (Cons x xs) = In (ConsF x (fromList xs))

We are now ready to generalise fold to be a catamorphism

Consider functions of type ListF a b -> b

h :: ListF a b -> b
h EmptyF = k
h (ConsF a y) = f a y
where
	k :: b
	f :: a -> b -> b

Functions of that type correspond to replacing the constructors of ListF a with functions k and f just like in foldr

A catamorphism arises from this diagram:
             fmap(cata alg) 
      f (Fix f)---------->f b
	In| ^              |alg
          V |inop          V
	Fix f -----------> b
               cata alg
inop is opposite of In
> inop :: Fix f -> f (Fix f)
> inop (In x) = x

where x has type f(Fix f)

So finally we can write cata by chasing the arrows around this square

> cata :: Functor f => (f b -> b) -> Fix f -> b
> cata alg x = (alg . fmap (cata alg) . inop) x

An alternative and equivalent definition:
> cata :: Functor f => (f b -> b) -> Fix f -> b
> cata alg (In x) = alg (fmap (cata alg) x)

To use this we only need to supply the alg
kills

We will define the function toList using a cata

> toList :: Fix (ListF a) -> List a
> toList = cata alg
> where
> 	alg :: ListF a (List a) -> List a
> 	alg EmptyF = Empty
> 	alg (ConsF x xs) = Cons x xs

Did... DId we just redefine list using list?!
WHAT THE FUCK, WHY, WHAT'S THE FUCKING POINT?!

Here is another function:

> toList' :: Fix (ListF a) -> [a]
> toList' = cata alg
> where
> 	alg :: ListF a [a] -> [a]
> 	alg EmptyF = []
> 	alg (ConsF x xs) = x:xs

YES NICK, IT'S ALMOST LIKE IT'S LITERALLY JUST THE DEFINITION OF A LIST OVER AGAIN
