Division

Suppose we want to add an operation to our languge that performs division:

> data Div_ k = Div k k
If we want to provide a semantics that collects all the variables, we must provide an algebra:

> divVars :: Div_ [Var] -> [Var]
> divVars :: (Div_ xs ys) = xs ++ ys

xs, ys :: [Var]

If we want a language with both division and addition, we need to take the coproduct of Add_ and Div_

This means expressions of the form 'Add_ :+: Div_'
