Any assignment where writing shitty code because it's faster I'm gonna hate

Also, imagine if you were an alien looking into this room now.
What would you think coughing means?
Maybe it's applause, maybe it's communicating something.
What it couldn't be is that like 20% of this room is sick, because such an enligtened society would SURELY have cured the common cold...

Wait, c with annotations? wegh

goddamn cucumberpatch

/it works
/i am trying to understand what this paragraph is trying to say
/like who did what?????????
I think the confusion is mostly just from the entire situation
Trying to apply copyright to memes
/i'm not sure why this beef is happening
/like it's not a new thing
/between epigram and wills memeorial
r/ootl is a savior
/how do i get in the loop tho
I mean, based on the original definition, find the ultimate mailing list I think
And since the only people who actually use mailing lists these days are librarians and linux nerds
/and scheem
If you DO manage to get in the actual loop, you're probably still out of the metaphorical loop, because so is everyone else in the loop.
/okay wills memeorial are being asses
/they originally had a picture showing the faces of the epigram team (now covered with anonymous masks)
/so it was bordering on targeted harrassment
Doxxing on facebook, impressive
Revealing someone's identity or personal details in a way likely to get them attacked
/it's no secret who is in the epigram team
/but it's different to make fun of the epigram and to make fun of the people behind it
/somehow
/that makes sense
I agree that it does, but I'm not sure the aliens would agree
/fair
/i'm hungry

Oh gods, we're so far down we can actually use set clock speed to measure time
/very low level
/i don't like it
Me neither, get me back behind an OS and like 2 more layers of OO abstraction

Oh no, look at the not syntax

!x becomes 1-x
AAAAAGH

Okay, so you can pipe a chan into void to just use it as a default
Assuming the chan is constantly sending though I guess
As with a timer
Yeah
makes sense
I think

I hate it already


Write sequential version
Get bit packing working
Farm stuff out to threads

When's the next evening you're vaguely free on?
/friday
/why?
/i could maybe to wednesday?
We need to actually do work?
/okay
/how about
/we don't start tonight
/BUT
/we work all of wednesday after uni?
/cause i kinda forgot and agreed to go gym tonight and just realised cause i'm dumb
I can start messing with the sequential bit on my own anyways
