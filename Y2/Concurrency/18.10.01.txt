Concurrency is logically simultaneous.
Parallelism is physically simultaneous.

Concurrency can be done on one core with time slicing (switching tasks constantly)
Paralellism is when two operations are actually running simultaneously as opposed to alternating.

/i'm confused abpout the image thing cause like if each section finishes on the pixel before the next one begins on then why do you lose information???
Because the operation they were running needed the adjacent pixels

Looking over someone's shoulder complaining about their code sounds good to me
/i feel like for us to both get a good amount of knowledge out of this, i should be the one on the computer most of the time and then when i get stuck you prod me (so like constantly)
You assume I have any idea how this works
