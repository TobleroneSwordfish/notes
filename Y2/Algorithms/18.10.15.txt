It's mildly worrying how well I appear to be functioning on 2 hours sleep
Maybe this is my natural state
Or maybe it's like being drunk and I think I'm fine but everyone else thinks I'm being a dick

Nice tree

grep > DNA research?
Seems legit

I was really hoping she wouldn't credit it

No-one read it the first time round

Buddha am I drunk?y

Three different string matching algorithms
KMP
BMH
FSM

naive is just match each character until mismatch
is garbage

KMP uses the naive algorithm but when a mismatch occurs at q+1 we know we have found q characters that match
Eliminates pointless shifts that you already know would mismatch
Only uses information about matches, not mismatches
Imma go with wikipedia cause this seems pretty dumb

The algorithms drive her mad
C O N T R A S T

Oh gods she left AF on again

Prefix table value = Longest possible string that is prefix and suffix and is not the string itself

Ruari doing inclusive or but she's so distracted by the beauty of the algorithms she just carried on

Shift the query string by the value given in the prefix table

KMP is O(n) and θ(n)

Better when alphabet is small

BMH works R-L
oof
Works by looking at text instead of pattern

On mismatch that doesn't occur anywhere, skip right past it
If the mismatch is in the pattern, shift to line it up with the occurence in the pattern
